    <h2>Driving</h2>

    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;The design generated for driving was to use gears or wheels. This way we could
      attach a motor to a wooden gear, and it would directly turn the wheels. Some
      of the benefits of this design are that it increases torque, and drives four
      wheels with two motors. It is also more stable and allows for more precise
      turning. However, because two wheels are on the same axle, it may make turning
      more difficult.

  <div class="scoop">
    <h2>Manny and Chemical Drums</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/scoop.jpg" />
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;The first design for to score Manny and the chemical drums was to have a scoop
      on the front of the robot. We would have a stick protrude from the robot to
      knock over the cans, then scoop them up to place them in the back. The scoop
      would also be able to scoop Manny up and place him in the starting zone to
      be scored. Some of the benefits are that it was simple to make, it has the
      ability to score both objects, it is easy to control, specific aim is not
      required, and is stable when being carried. Some of the drawbacks are the
      cans have to be knocked over, it weighs a lot, you have to use a wall to get
      objects into the scoop, the cans could possibly fall into the robot, and needs
      to be shaken down after the game starts. It does require a motor, but the motor
      can also be used to aim the slingshot. The mechanism would also counterweight
      the slingshot.

    <h2>Shooting the Flames</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/shoot.jpg" />
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;There was one main idea of how to shoot the flames, using a slingshot. It 
      has a metal plate that the ball leans against, and is pulled back with bungee.
      Then the ball is released, and a new ball falls into place.  We originally
      used a grenade pin to release the ball, but it required too much force to
      release the ball, took a long time to reload, was hard to control, and required
      two motors. Eventually, the release mechanism was built into the firing mechanisms,
      making the slingshot more simple.
