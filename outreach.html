        &emsp;&emsp;South Forsyth HS and the Forsyth Alliance will host one of the largest First Lego
        League tournaments in the state of Georgia in December. Team members
        volunteer as judges, help with registration, set up and break down of the facility
        and runners for the teams. The team is responsible for assembly of the game
        pieces. South Forsyth mentors one of these teams to help with programming and
        robot design.

        &emsp;&emsp;Robotics was promoted through the school with a t-shirt cannon that was brought to home
        football games. T-shirts were fired with messages that promoted robotics and encouraged
        students to come and participate with technology.

        Our school also hosts a summer camp for robotics. South Forsyth HS and its sister
        school, Lambert HS, jointly hosted a robotics camp in June 2016. An open invitation
        was extended to all elementary schools in the southern area of the county. 33
        campers and 15 high school volunteers participated. Campers were given a mission
        to build and program VEX IQ robots over the course of the week.
