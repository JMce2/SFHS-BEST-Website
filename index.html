         <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;All students are required to complete a safety training course
          called Safety Pollution and prevention (SP2). SP2 is a company that provides
          a wide variety of safety training. Students are required to complete the
          Construction course in order to participate. In addition to many things,
          the course teaches kids about power tool safety, first aid, fire safety,
          and how to properly use personal protective equipment.

         <h2>Robot C/Simulink</h2>
         <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;When we coded, we began in RobotC because it was easier to
          understand for most people on the team, as many had worked with the language
          before. Simple things like the drivetrain motors (before speed control)
          were programmed from here and uploaded to the microcontroller so things
          like speed and torque could be tested and accounted for during the design
          process.<br />&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, this was moved over to Simulink when
          the slightly more difficult things were programmed, as they could be simulated
          and confirmed to work before uploading to the robot.

         <p>
           &emsp;&emsp;To analyze potential solutions, sketches and some rough cardboard models
           were made to see the idea form. While many people have an idea in their
           head, once it has been made into a 3D model it is easier to communicate
           your idea to others.  It also forces the person who had to idea a recognize
           and address problems that they had not foreseen when thinking of it.
