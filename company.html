    <h1>The Company</h1>
     <p>
       &emsp;&emsp;Our company is split into two main divisions, building and marketing. Building handles building the robot and the field, while marketing is responsible for all parts of the BEST Award. While our company does have two main divisions, we don’t restrict people to any division, but instead encourage them to be a part of both divisions. We have five leaders on our company that were picked off of experience and dedication.The Chief Executive Officer is in charge of the build division and the main leader. The Chief Marketing Officer is in charge of the marketing division. The Chief Technical Officer is in charge of programming and electrical work. She is not in charge of a specific division, as programming is required in both divisions (website and robot’s program). The Chief Financial Officer is in charge of reaching out to new sponsors, maintaining sponsor relationships, and managing the company’s budget. The Chief Operations Officer is in charge of travel arrangements, scheduling, organizing outreach, and communication. Our company has used a similar structure every year, the only difference being the addition of the CFO. We have found having the divisions effective for organization, while promoting flexibility to allow everyone to do what they are interested in.
